# Fika-Installer

A work-in-progress console application for installing Fika, Fika-Server, and Fika-Headless.

## Objective

The goal is to make the tool as simple as possible with minimal user interaction. No bloated features, no complex GUI, and no configuration files - just execute and install. It is not a launcher or a configuration tool, and never will be.

## Linux Support

Linux support is not planned. However, only minimal code modifications should be required for Linux compatibility. Feel free to submit a PR for Linux support.
